- 👋 Hi, I'm Jose Miguel Redondo and my nickname on GitHub is "Mesenho" because of where I'm from.
- 👀 I’m interested in in Python, I just did a course to recycle myself professionally. I'm unemployed and I'm looking for alternatives in this sector.
- 🌱 I have just finished a course with IBM/BeJob called "Python Full Stack" where we have seen HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python being this last one the most outstanding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python code in order to learning on the job
- 👉 Programming is my passion and it's what I learned as a kid with structured languages like Basic, Cobol, Pascal, etc.
- 💭 Now, meanwhile I find a job, I take advantage of the time to recycle myself.

 My email address is: 📧 ironet.jmr@gmail.com
